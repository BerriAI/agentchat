# agentchat

Connect chat platforms to any Python agent

AgentChat handles messages, conversations, acknowledgements, deduplication, and replies. Your application owns the agent

## Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[openai]"
```

## Slack and OpenAI Agents SDK

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner
from agentchat import AgentChat
from agentchat.channels import Slack
from agentchat.integrations import should_reply, to_openai_input

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="Continue the task when participants provide missing information. "
                 "Treat speaker labels as identities, not permissions.",
)

slack = Slack.from_env(ack_emoji=None)
app = AgentChat(channels=[slack])


@app.on_message
async def respond(context):
    # Authenticated apps authorize the current sender before these calls.
    await slack.subscribe(context.message)
    inputs = to_openai_input(await context.history(limit=30), include_senders=True)
    if not context.message.addressed and not await should_reply(inputs, model=agent.model):
        return None
    async with context.working():
        result = await Runner.run(agent, input=inputs)
        await context.reply(str(result.final_output))


asyncio.run(app.run())
```

AgentChat does not depend on an agent framework. The handler can call OpenAI Agents SDK, Pydantic AI, LangGraph, or your own runtime

## Slack setup

Create a Slack app with Socket Mode enabled, then add these bot scopes:

- `app_mentions:read`
- `chat:write`
- `im:history`
- `channels:history`
- `groups:history` (for private channels)
- `reactions:write` (or set `ack_emoji=None`)

Subscribe to `app_mention`, `message.im`, `message.channels`, and `message.groups`.
Install the app and invite it to the channels where it should respond. Existing
installations need to be reinstalled when adding scopes. Then export its tokens:

```bash
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-..."
export SLACK_APP_TOKEN="xapp-..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Run the example:

```bash
python examples/slack_openai_agent.py
```

Send the bot a direct message or mention it in a channel. Follow-up direct messages
share one conversation. Plain DMs receive replies in the main DM; explicit DM
thread replies stay in that thread. Channel mentions receive replies under the
original thread root.

Call `await slack.subscribe(context.message)` after your application accepts a
channel conversation to receive its subsequent replies without another mention.
For an authenticated application, check the sender's access **before** subscribing.
Unrelated channel messages and threads are ignored. Other people's mentions remain
in the message text; only the bot's own mention is removed.

Subscriptions default to memory, bounded to the latest 1,000 threads. To retain
them across restarts, pass `thread_subscriptions=` with an object implementing
`async contains(conversation_id) -> bool` and `async add(conversation_id) -> None`.
The application owns that store's expiry policy. Subscribing does not authorize
other participants; check each incoming sender independently.

## Working indicators

Use Slack’s native “Your Agent is working…” indicator after accepting a request:

```python
async with context.working() as activity:
    result = await run_agent()
    await activity.update("is checking the results…")
    await context.reply(result)
```

The helper refreshes every 60 seconds and clears on exit, including failures and
cancellation. Status updates stay outside conversation history and create no chat
messages. Status API failures are logged without preventing the agent’s answer.
Slack expires an abandoned indicator after two minutes. Set `ack_emoji=None` on
`Slack(...)` or `Slack.from_env(...)` to use the indicator without eyes reactions.
The SDK keeps existing reaction defaults for backward compatibility.

For durable workers, use `await app.set_status(channel, source, "is working…")`
(or `await context.set_status(...)`) and clear with an empty string. This one-shot
API propagates provider failures; setting the same status is safe to retry. Your
worker owns refresh/recovery from persisted task state. Posting a bot message
clears Slack’s indicator, so refresh it again if more work remains. A `working()`
context is for one in-process task, not a replacement for durable orchestration.

Slack automatically prefixes the app’s name. `assistant.threads.setStatus` accepts
`chat:write` (existing `assistant:write` also works). The indicator targets the
existing reply thread, including explicitly threaded DMs. Plain top-level DMs and
channels without status support return `False` rather than opening an unexpected
thread. This feature does not move conversations into Slack’s new agent-session
channels or require a new installation permission.

## Slack user profiles

Slack mentions contain IDs such as `<@U012ABCDEF>`. Resolve one through the native
[`users.info`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.info/) API:

```python
user = await slack.get_user("U012ABCDEF")
user.id
user.team_id
user.display_name
user.email
user.is_bot
user.deleted
```

Profile lookup requires `users:read`; email also requires `users:read.email`.
Reinstall an existing Slack app after adding scopes. Email is optional, and the
SDK never guesses it from a display name. Slack API errors, including missing
scopes and rate limits, propagate to the caller. Malformed profiles raise
`ValueError` without including the profile in the error message.

Lookup is explicit and does not run on every message. Check the requesting user's
authorization first and expose it as a tool in your chosen agent framework when
needed. Applications decide whether a returned user, including Slack Connect
users, bots and deactivated users, is eligible for an operation. Treat profile
fields as data, and match email against the destination system's real records.

## Shared conversation context

`await context.history(limit=30)` returns the thread root and recent messages,
including the current turn. When the channel supports native thread history, it
fetches that shared context even after a restart. Otherwise it uses the local
conversation store. The total is bounded to `limit` (2–100), preserving the root
and latest messages. Fetching history never replays handlers or copies previous
messages into local state. Read errors propagate instead of silently supplying
incomplete context.

`message.thread_id` identifies a platform thread, or is `None` for an unthreaded
conversation. `message.addressed` is true for DMs and explicit bot mentions;
untagged subscribed Slack replies set it to false. Other channel adapters can
provide these fields and implement the optional `ThreadHistoryChannel` protocol.
Existing adapters keep working without implementing native history.

The optional OpenAI Agents integration offers two helpers:

- `to_openai_input(messages, include_senders=True)` labels incoming messages with
  `Speaker: "sender-id"` above their original text. Assistant messages remain
  unchanged so history demonstrates the intended reply format. Message newlines
  stay intact; only sender IDs are JSON-escaped. The default preserves all text
  unchanged. Speaker identities distinguish participants, not permissions.
- `await should_reply(inputs, model=agent.model)` uses a separate, tool-free model
  call to distinguish task continuations from side conversations. It accepts
  custom `instructions` and `run_config`; tracing is disabled by default and
  errors propagate. This is an opt-in relevance check, not authorization. The
  example invokes it only for messages that do not explicitly address the bot.

Authorize the current sender **before** fetching history or running a reply
filter. The SDK core does not invoke models or depend on OpenAI Agents; other
frameworks can consume the same normalized messages and implement their own filter.

### Direct Slack history access

`await slack.thread_history(message, limit=50)` reads the thread root and recent
replies before the current message from Slack's `conversations.replies` API.
Returned `Message` objects preserve sender IDs; only this bot's messages have the
assistant role. This lets a new process recover a shared conversation without
mixing users' credentials or private agent/tool state.

Authorize the current sender before fetching history. History is context, not
authorization to execute earlier participants' requests. Keep speaker identities
when passing it to an agent. Lookup uses the installed token's history scopes;
Slack API errors propagate. Pagination is bounded to 500 messages and fails on
incomplete results. The returned context retains the root plus the latest replies
within `limit` (2–100); a new root message has no earlier thread history.

## Core interface

```python
@app.on_message
async def respond(context):
    return await my_agent(context)
```

The context exposes the normalized message, sender, and conversation:

```python
context.message
context.sender
context.conversation

history = await context.history(limit=30)
await context.reply("Hello")
```

Use `context.conversation.history(limit=30)` when you specifically want only the
messages already held in your application's state store.

Incoming messages are acknowledged, deduplicated, and serialized by conversation before the handler runs. Returning a string posts it to the originating Slack DM or thread

Slack replies display the full response by default using expanded section blocks.
Long text replies are split across sections within a single Slack message, with
code fences balanced across section boundaries. The original text remains the
notification and accessibility fallback. Text replies that require more than Slack's
50-block limit raise `ValueError` before sending; split those into separate replies.

## Incoming attachments

`Message.attachments` holds a tuple of `Attachment` references with a provider
file ID and optional name, media type and byte size. Slack accepts `file_share`
events and file-only DMs, mentions and subscribed thread replies. Native thread
history also retains attachment references, including messages without text.
The existing workspace, bot-message and thread-subscription checks still apply.
Normalizing an event never downloads files or stores private file URLs.

After authorizing the sender, explicitly fetch a current-message file:

```python
@app.on_message
async def respond(context):
    for attachment in context.message.attachments:
        file = await context.download_attachment(attachment, max_bytes=10 * 1024 * 1024)
        # Validate file.content, store it, or prepare a multimodal model input.
        # file.name and file.media_type describe the freshly fetched metadata.
    return "Received your attachments."
```

`DownloadedFile` carries the file ID, name, bytes and optional media type. Bytes
are never appended to AgentChat history or downloaded automatically by
`to_openai_input`, which remains a text adapter. Applications own content
validation, image previews, persistence, audio transcription and model-specific
multimodal inputs. Treat file contents as untrusted reference data.

Downloads require the bot's `files:read` scope; reinstall an existing Slack app
after adding it. AgentChat resolves `files.info` by ID, validates the private
Slack host, sends the bot token only to that host, disables redirects and checks
both the declared size and streamed byte count. Errors and cancellation propagate
without automatic retry. The default per-file limit is 10 MB; hosts can pass a
different positive `max_bytes` budget. Slack normalization retains at most five
files per message.

Custom channels can implement `FileDownloadChannel`. The application-level
`app.download_attachment(channel, source, attachment, max_bytes=...)` checks that
the reference belongs to the source message; unsupported channels raise
`TypeError`. Downloads from a historical Slack message can use this API with
that historical message as `source` after the host authorizes access.

Host-owned signed webhooks can reuse
`agentchat.channels.slack_files.slack_attachments(files, limit=5)` for normalization
and `download_slack_file(attachment, bot_token=..., request=..., max_bytes=...,
before_download=...)` for transport. The async `request(api, payload)` callback
authenticates the Slack metadata call. The optional guard runs before metadata
retrieval, before downloading and before returning bytes, so hosts can recheck
revoked access. The host remains responsible for verifying signed events,
workspace/sender authorization, durable queues and recovering any file references
omitted by a provider event. Event-provided download URLs are never used.

## Rich replies and file uploads

Send application-selected bytes and a rich reply to the accepted conversation:

```python
from agentchat import RichReply, UploadFile

# Your application has authorized this sharing and verified the bytes and URL.
files = await context.upload_files((
    UploadFile(filename="demo.webm", content=verified_video_bytes, title="Working demo"),
))
await context.reply_rich(RichReply(
    text=f"Working demo and PR: {verified_pr_url}",
    blocks=({
        "type": "section",
        "text": {"type": "mrkdwn", "text": f"<{verified_pr_url}|View PR>"},
    },),
))
```

`RichReply` contains fallback `text`, optional `blocks`, and optional `attachments`.
Blocks and attachments must match the receiving provider's format; the Slack
adapter accepts Slack Block Kit and attachment objects. The existing `reply(str)`
API remains available. Custom channels can implement the optional `RichReplyChannel`
and `FileUploadChannel` protocols. Unsupported capabilities raise `TypeError`, so
the host can choose a text or protected-link fallback explicitly.

Slack section blocks, including sections inside attachments, default to
[`expand: true`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block/)
so readers do not need to click **Show more**. Set `"expand": False` on a section
to opt into Slack's collapsed display. Other block types and explicit expansion
choices are preserved, and the adapter does not modify your input objects.
When a `RichReply` omits blocks, its text is rendered in expanded sections too.

`UploadFile` carries a filename, bytes, and optional title; it does not load paths
or fetch URLs. Uploads return `UploadedFile` receipts with a provider ID and an
optional permalink. They do not append binary content or invented file messages
to conversation history. Rich replies append the confirmed response, like text
replies. Durable hosts can call `app.reply_rich(channel, source, content)` and
`app.upload_files(channel, source, files)` with their saved source message.

Slack file uploads require the bot's `files:write` scope; reinstall an existing app
after adding it. Rich replies use `chat:write`. These APIs expose no new agent
tools and grant no application permissions. The host owns sender authorization,
trusted destination bindings, file selection, content checks, size budgets,
paused-conversation rules, and durable delivery state. Each call makes one attempt;
provider failures propagate and uploads are never retried automatically. The
default Slack client disables automatic retries; an injected client or transport
must also use one-attempt behavior. A timeout may mean Slack accepted a send or
file share, so retain uncertain outcomes rather than blindly retrying them.

Custom Slack webhook or rotating-OAuth adapters can reuse
`agentchat.channels.slack_media.upload_slack_files(files, request=..., channel_id=..., thread_ts=..., before_send=...)`.
The `request(api_method, payload)` callback supplies the host's one-attempt Slack API
transport. The optional async `before_send()` callback rechecks host authorization
before every allocation, byte transfer, and final share. The helper owns upload URL
validation, transfer and receipt verification; it does not require Socket Mode.
`rich_payload(reply)` builds content fields while the host supplies its saved routing.

## Mirroring web inputs into Slack

Use `app.mirror()` to display an already accepted web input in a bound Slack
conversation, without calling the agent handler or creating another model turn:

```python
from agentchat import Message, Sender

# Authorize the signed-in user and load the session's saved Slack source first.
external = Message(
    id="web:session-123:message-456",  # Stable ID from your saved message
    conversation_id=slack_source.conversation_id,
    channel="web",
    sender=Sender(id=verified_user.id, display_name=verified_user.name),
    text=saved_message.text,
    role="user",
)
await app.mirror(slack, slack_source, external, origin="My app web")
```

Slack shows a bot post labelled “Alice · via My app web”; it does not impersonate
Alice's Slack account. Inputs remain `user` messages in AgentChat state and in
native thread history, including after a restart. Only mirror metadata posted by
the configured bot is recognized. Bot echoes never invoke the handler. Plain-text
blocks, escaped fallback text and disabled unfurls prevent input from creating
Slack mentions. No additional scopes are needed beyond posting/history access.

The application must verify the sender, authorize sharing, and resolve the
original conversation from a trusted session binding. Do not accept destination
IDs or sender identity from browser input. Preserve your own rules for paused
conversations. **Each call attempts one send.** Use a durable outbox with a unique
key per message/chunk, save it with the web input, and mark sends in flight before
posting. Do not automatically retry an ambiguous timeout: Slack may have accepted
the post. A stable `Message.id` alone does not provide provider deduplication.

Inputs are limited to 2,800 characters per call; split larger inputs into ordered,
stable chunks in your outbox. `app.mirror()` appends the sent user message to state
but never invokes a handler or claims an inbound event. If your application owns
history, use `slack.mirror()` directly. Custom webhook adapters can implement the
optional `MirroringChannel` capability and reuse
`agentchat.channels.slack_mirror.mirror_payload()` for safe Slack content.

## Using an existing agent runner

An application that already owns history, authorization and durable deduplication
can bind directly to the public channel API without a second `AgentChat` state store:

```python
slack = Slack.from_env()

async def receive(channel, message):
    # Verify the sender, claim the message ID and run your existing agent here.
    await slack.subscribe(message)
    await channel.reply(message, "Your response")

slack.bind(receive)
asyncio.run(slack.run())
```

With direct binding, the application owns deduplication and request ordering.
`message.id` identifies the Slack message across retries and duplicate
`app_mention`/`message` deliveries. Metadata includes the original `event_id`,
`team_id`, `channel_id`, `channel_type`, `message_timestamp`, and reply timestamp.

`Slack.run()` checks the bot identity. Pass `workspace_id=` to reject a token or
event from another workspace. `await slack.is_connected()` exposes socket readiness.
Socket envelopes are acknowledged before processing in tracked background tasks.
`max_pending_events` defaults to 64; excess envelopes are left unacknowledged for
Slack's retry policy. `await slack.close()` closes the socket, then drains tasks
for up to 20 seconds before cancelling unfinished work. This is bounded in-process
delivery, not a durable queue; applications performing writes need their own journal.
